# ShowShelf

ðŸŽ¥ An easy-to-use watchlist application for keeping track of shows and movies. 
Keep track of your thoughts and progress along the way :) <br>
This web application was built with Python and the Django framework, 
and supports all aspects of CRUD functionality. Worked with SQLite databases 
and rendered tables using HTML. Users are able to create an account and log in to manage their list of shows.
